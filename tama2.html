        <h1>Introduction to CSS</h1>
    

        <p>This document gives an introduction to <abbr title = 'Cascading Style Sheets'>CSS</abbr> (Cascading Style Sheets),
        including its purpose and structure, and some details about selectors,
        properties, and property values.</p>

        <section>
            <h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>

            <p><abbr title ="Cascading Style">CSS</abbr> is a <em title = "スタイルシート言語">stylesheet language</em>. A stylesheet is a collection of styles
            for styling a document. Styling can range from high-level overall layout
            of a document to precise details such as font size. CSS was developed
            to work well for Web pages written in HTML. In theory, it is possible
            to use other stylesheet languages for styling Web pages, <strong>but </strong>in practice,
            CSS is the only choice.</p>

            CSS can also be used for other XML documents.
            Parts of CSS are also used in other technologies.
            CSS properties are used in <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> and <abbr title ="Extensible Stylesheet Language">
            XSL</abbr>. CSS selectors are used in many
            libraries to select parts of a document. So learning CSS is useful even
            if you are <strong>not</strong> very interested in Web page design.

            <h3>A Very Short History of CSS</h3>
            <p>CSS was created by <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A5kon_Wium_Lie">Håkon Wium Lie</a> and <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bert_Bos">Bert Bos</a> 
                at <abbr title = "World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>. There were originally
                many different proposals for how styling should be handled, but eventually
                CSS won. Today, the CSS specification is split into many modules that can
                be on different levels.</p>

            <p>
                Separating style (CSS) and structure (HTML markup) of documents is
                important for the following six reasons:
                <h4>1. The same style can be used for more than one Web page,
                or even a whole Web site.</h4>
                <h4>2. Web page source is simpler and cleaner, thus easier to read or write.
                is smaller.</h4>
                <h4>4. Changing the styles on a Web page or a Web site is easier.
                <h4>5. Work can easily be split between Web designers (CSS) and
                authors/editors (HTML).</h4>
                <h4>6. Different style sheets can be used for screen display, for print,
                and for other cases.</h4>
            </p>
            
            <p>CSS is <strong>not</strong> an exact style sheet language. Even with the same style sheet,
            a Web page may look slightly different on different computers and with
            different browsers. For example, <strong>not</strong> all computers have the
            same fonts. CSS makes it easy to specify <strong>only part of the style</strong>,
            leaving the rest to the browser.</p>
        </aside>
        
        <section>
            <h2 id = "example"> Simple Example</h2>

            <p>This is a simple CSS stylesheet:</p>

           <pre> 
                body { font-size: 14pt; font-family: serif; line-height: 120%;
                    background-color: lightgreen;
                    }
                h1 { font-size: 130%; font-weight: bold; }
                h2 { font-size: 120%; margin-before: 0.5em; }
                h3 { font-size: 110%; }
                p  { text-indent: 1.5em; }
                aside { float: right; width: 40%; font-size: 90%; }
            </pre>

                <p>This stylesheet has 6 style rules. The first rule says that the body
                font size is 14 points, the font should have serifs, the line height
                is 120% of the font size (i.e. there is a 20% interline space), and
                the background color is light green.</p>
            
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2 id = "Basic Syntax">Basic Syntax</h2>

        <p>The main elements of the CSS syntax are <em title = "セレクター">selectors</em>, <em title="プロパティ">properties</em>, and
        <em title="特性値">property values</em>. A CSS stylesheet is a collection of rules.
        Each rule consists of some selector(s) and a <em titel = "宣言ブロック">declaration block</em> in brackets.
        A declaration block contains some declarations, separated or terminated
        by semicolons. A declaration consists of a property name and a property
        value.</p>

        <p>In the above example, body and h1 are examples of selectors.
        <code>{ font-size: 110%; }</code> is a declaration block.<code> background-color: #FCF</code> and
        <code>margin-before: 0.5em</code> are declarations. <code>font-weight</code> and <code>float</code> are
        property names. <code>14pt</code>, <code>bold</code>, and <code>90%</code> are property values.</p>

        <p>Comments can be included in CSS. They start with <code>/*</code> and end with <code>*/</code>.
        This is the same as in the programming language C. But CSS <strong>does not</strong>
        support <code>//</code> comments the way most modern C compilers do.</p>

        <p>Parsing of CSS is tolerant to unknown selectors, property names,
        and property values. This makes it easy to introduce new properties.
        When using a new property, stylesheet designers have to be <strong>careful</strong>
        that the stylesheet still works well on browsers that <strong>do not</strong> support
        the new property.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2 id = "Selectors">Selectors</h2>

            <p>Selectors define where the style in the following declaration block
            is applied. The following table gives examples of the main types of
            selectors and their meaning:</p>
            <table>
                <tbody>
                <tr><th>selector</th>  <th>selector</th>            <th>applicability</th>
                <th>example</th>   <th>type</th></tr>

                <tr><td><code>*</code></td>         <td>universal</td> <td>selector</td>  <td>matches</td> <td>any element</td></tr>
                <tr><td><code>body</code></td>      <td>element name</td>        <td>element</td> <td>content</td> <td>(and all its subelements)</td></tr>
                <tr><td><code>.warning</code></td>  <td>class selector</td>      <td>elements with class='warning'</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
                <tr><td><code>#syntax</code></td>   <td>id selector</td>         <td>element with id='syntax'</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
                <tr><td><code>a:link</code></td>    <td>link pseudoclass</td>    <td>link that is not yet visited</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
                <tr><td><code>a:visited</code></td> <td>link pseudoclass</td>    <td>link that was visited</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
                <tr><td><code>p</code></td> <td>code</td>    <td>descendant</td>          <td>code element somewhere in p</td><td></td></tr>
                <tr><th></th><th></th>       <th>combinator</th><th></th><th></th></tr>
                <tr><td><code>p></code></td>  <td>code</td>  <td>child</td> <td>combinator</td>    <td>code element that is a child of p</td></tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <section>
            <h2 id = "Properties">Properties</h2>

            <p>Properties indicate what kind of style setting should be done. There are
            properties for <strong>margins</strong>, <strong>borders</strong>, <strong>fonts</strong>, <strong>colors</strong>, <strong>backgrounds</strong>, c<strong>olumns</strong>, <strong>grids</strong>,
            <strong>scrolling</strong>, <strong>animation</strong>, <strong>relative</strong> and <strong>absolute positioning</strong>, and many more.
            Properties often come in groups, for example font, font-family, font-size,
            font-weight, and so on.</p>

            Cascading Style Sheets, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS1/">level 1</a> started with about <strong>50</strong> properties. The
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-2021/">CSS Snapshot 2021</a> lists about <strong>300</strong> properties. You can use the
            caniuse.com Web site to find out on which browsers and which versions
            of a browser a property is supported.
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2 id = "Property Values">Property Values</h2>

        <p> Property values define the exact setting of a property. Many properties
            have the same or similar property values, e.g. for colors and sizes.</p>

            <p>There are two ways to indicate colors, by name and numerically.
            Color names come from a long list defined in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/REC-css-color-3-20180619/">CSS Color Module Level 3</a>.
            Numerical color values can be of the form <code>#rgb</code> or <code>#rrggbb</code> or <code>rgb(r,g,b)</code>.
            There are also notations for other color spaces such as RGBA and HSL.</p>

            <p>Sizes can be absolute or relative. They are defined in
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-3/">CSS Values and Units Module Level 3</a>. Absolute sizes can be
            units such as <strong>pt</strong> (point), <strong>cm</strong>, or <strong>mm</strong>. Relative sizes can be expressed
            in <strong>percent (%)</strong> or <strong>em</strong> (the height of an uppercase M).</p>

            <p> There are many other kinds of property values.
            Please check which property values can be used with which property.</p>

            <h2 id ="How to Apply CSS to HTML" >How to Apply CSS to HTML</h2>

            <p>There are several different ways to apply CSS to <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. The best way is
            to have external style sheets and to link them to HTML with the
            <strong>link element</strong> in the head element. The following is an example:</p>

            <pre>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="my_stylesheet.css"&gt;</pre>

            <p>A second way is to include some style rules in a style element in the
            head element of an HTML document. A third way is to add some declarations
            in a style attribute on a specific element. These ways are only suited
            for specific local style settings, and are not recommended. But they take
            priority over external stylesheet settings.</p>

            <aside>
                <h3> SCSS</h3>
                <p>CSS does <strong>not</strong> allow to nest selectors and declaration blocks.
                For large style sheets, such nesting can be convenient.
                <em title="Source Code Control System">SCSS</em> is an extension of CSS to provide nesting and some other
                additional features. Browsers do not understand it, so SCSS
                has to be converted to CSS on the server side. Recently, a
                CSS Nesting Module has been proposed, so this may change.</p>
            </aside>
        </section>

        <h2 id="Cascading">Cascading</h2>

        <p>We finally come to the explanation of the 'C' in CSS. CSS stylesheets
        work by cascading. The same property can be set to different values
        on the same text. Such settings can come from different style sheets,
        style elements, and style attributes. They can come from outer elements
        (such as the body element) or from inner elements. They can apply to an
        element, a class, or an id. They can come from a shorthand property that
        sets several related properties together or from a more specific property.
        They can also come from an author stylesheet, a user stylesheet, or a
        browser stylesheet.</p>

        <p>All these settings are cascaded. Longer selectors win over shorter selectors.
        Inner settings win over outer settings. Later settings (e.g. in the same
        stylesheet) win over earlier settings. Understanding these precedences,
        one can write short and precise stylesheets.</p>
